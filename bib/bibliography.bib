  abstract = {Abstract Background andAims The commodity purchase task is a simulated demand procedure that is easy and quick to complete (< 5 minutes) as well as adaptable for remote delivery and use with varied study populations. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to synthesize research using the commodity purchase task with illicit substances to evaluate the magnitude of omnibus effects sizes and moderators of the correlation of demand indices with quantity–frequency (QF) and severity measures. Design Random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regressions involving studies with cross-sectional correlational designs. Setting and Participants Eleven studies, 10 outcomes and 2146 participants from two countries (USA and UK) published up to 1 October 2018. Measurements Omnibus effect sizes (correlation coefficients) of five demand indices from the commodity purchase task [intensity (unconstrained consumption), elasticity (price sensitivity), Omax (maximum expenditure), Pmax (price at maximum expenditure) and breakpoint (first price of zero consumption)] with QF and severity measures. Meta-regression models tested moderators of effect sizes (i.e. sample age and sex composition, commodity type and number of prices used in the commodity purchase task). Findings Significant omnibus effect sizes were observed with QF and severity measures for intensity (r = 0.32/0.28, QF/severity, respectively), elasticity (r = −0.14/−0.18), Omax (r = 0.30/0.29) and breakpoint (r = 0.17/0.22) values. Pmax was only significantly associated with severity measures (r = 0.15). The percentage of female participants and number of prices used in the purchase task significantly moderated Pmax and breakpoint effect-size estimates in that stronger associations were observed in samples with a greater percentage of women and in studies using tasks with more price points. Commodity type (cannabis versus cocaine) did not significantly moderate associations involving any demand index. Conclusions Behavioral economic demand as measured by the commodity purchase task is consistently correlated with measures of illicit substance use quantity–frequency and severity.},

  abstract = {Abstract Background and Aims A cigarette purchase task (CPT) aims to characterize individual variation in the reinforcing value of tobacco. This meta-analysis estimated the associations between cigarette demand, tobacco consumption and nicotine dependence using this task. Design A meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies identified by PubMed and PsycINFO databases was conducted. Fixed- and random-effects models were used. The study also examined the model used to derive elasticity of demand (exponential or exponentiated) as a potential moderator. Publication bias was assessed using ‘fail-safe N', Begg–Mazumdar test, Egger's test, Tweedie's trim-and-fill approach and meta-regression of publication year with effect size. Setting Studies from any setting that reported coefficient correlations on the tested associations. Participants Daily cigarette users (i.e. 5 to 38 cigarettes per day; n = 7649). Measurements Cigarette consumption, nicotine dependence and five tobacco demand indicators: intensity (i.e. consumption at no cost), elasticity (i.e. sensitivity to rises in costs), Omax (maximum expenditure), Pmax (i.e. price at which consumption becomes elastic) and breakpoint (i.e. price at which consumption ceases). Findings Twenty-three studies met inclusion criteria. All the CPT indices were significantly correlated with smoking behavior (rs = 0.044–0.572, Ps = 0.012–10−8). Medium-to-large effect size associations were present for intensity, Omax, and elasticity, whereas small effects were obtained for breakpoint and Pmax. Evidence of a moderating effect of the different elasticity modeling approaches was not present. There was limited evidence of publication bias. Conclusions All five demand indices derived from the cigarette purchase task by (CPT) were robustly associated with cigarette consumption and tobacco dependence. Of the demand indices, maximum expenditure, intensity and elasticity exhibited the largest magnitude associations.},

State-oriented purchase tasks are sensitive to phasic manipulations, but with heterogeneous methods and findings. The aim of this meta-analysis was to characterize the literature examining manipulations of reinforcing value, as measured by purchase tasks and multiple-choice procedures, to inform etiological models and treatment approaches Methods A random-effects meta-analysis of published findings in peer-reviewed articles. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) protocol, studies were gathered through searches in PsycINFO and PubMed/MEDLINE (published 22 May 2018). Searches returned 34 unique studies (aggregate sample n = 2402; average sample size = 68.94) yielding 126 effect sizes. Measurements included change (i.e. Cohen's d) in six behavioral economic indices (intensity, breakpoint, Omax, Pmax, elasticity, cross-over point) in relation to six experimental manipulations (cue exposure, stress/negative affect, reinforcer magnitude, pharmacotherapy, behavioral interventions, opportunity cost). Results Cue exposure (d range = 0.25–0.44, all Ps < 0.05) and reinforcer magnitude [d = 0.60; 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.18, 1.01; P < 0.005] manipulations resulted in significant increases in behavioral economic demand across studies. Stress/negative affect manipulations also resulted in a small, significant increase in Omax (d = 0.18; 95\% CI = 0.01, 0.34; P = 0.03); all other effect sizes for negative affect/stress were non-significant, albeit similar in size (d range = 0.14–0.18). In contrast, pharmacotherapy (d range = −0.37 to −0.49; Ps < 0.04), behavioral intervention (d = −0.36 to −1.13) and external contingency (d = −1.42; CI = −2.30, −0.54; P = 0.002) manipulations resulted in a significant decrease in intensity. Moderators (substance type) explained some of the heterogeneity in findings across meta-analyses. Conclusions In behavioral economic studies, purchase tasks and multiple-choice procedures appear to provide indices that are sensitive to manipulations found to influence motivation to consume addictive substances in field experiments.},

  abstract = {Background
The Alcohol Purchase Task (APT) is a behavioral economic assessment of alcohol demand (i.e., motivation for consumption during escalating levels of response cost) using simulated marketplace survey techniques. While the APT is often used and widely cited, to date, there has yet to be a systematic review elucidating the variability in administering and analyzing the APT. The purpose of the current paper is to address this knowledge gap in the literature by cataloging the various purchase task methodologies and providing recommendations and future areas of inquiry.
Methods
The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) methodology was utilized (Prospero: No. CRD42017072159). Searches through Google Scholar, PsychINFO, PubMed, and SpringerLink databases identified 47 empirical articles referencing the use of an APT and published through the year 2016. Articles were coded for demographic and procedural characteristics, structural characteristics of the APT itself, and characteristics of data analysis.
Results
Results indicate substantial variation within categories and suggest that there is no standard approach to administering the APT or analyzing the responses generated from it. The results underscore the need for researchers to report as much information as possible related to administration, instructions, price structuring, and analytical approach, as we found that many articles did not provide these details.
Conclusion
Enhancing the transparency of APT methods and analyses in published reports will aid in reproducibility as well as future meta-analytic studies of alcohol demand that could lead to the development of best-practice recommendations for this procedure.},

  issn     = {0376-8716},
  pages    = {108523},
  abstract = {Background
Behavioral economic theory predicts decisions to drink are cost benefit analyses, and heavy episodic drinking occurs when benefits outweigh costs. Social interaction is a known benefit associated with alcohol use. Although heavy drinking is typically considered more likely during more social drinking events, people who drink heavily in isolation tend to report greater severity of use. This study explicitly disaggregates between-person and within-person effects of sociality on heavy episodic drinking and examines behavioral economic moderators.
Methods
We used day-level survey data over an 18-week period in a community adult sample recruited through crowdsourcing (mTurk; N = 223). Behavioral economic indices were examined to determine if macro person-level variables (alcohol demand, delay discounting, proportionate alcohol-related reinforcement [R-ratio]) interact with event-level social context to predict heavy drinking episodes.
Results
Mixed effect models indicated significant between-person and within-person social context associations. Specifically, people with a higher proportion of total drinking occasions in social contexts had decreased odds of heavy drinking, whereas being in a social context for a specific drinking occasion was associated with increased odds of heavy drinking. Person-level R-Ratio, demand elasticity, and breakpoint variables interacted with social context to predict heavy episodic drinking, such that the event-level social context association was stronger when R-Ratios, alcohol price insensitivity, and demand breakpoints were high.
Conclusions
These results demonstrate an ecological fallacy, in which the size and direction of effects were divergent at different levels of analysis, and highlight the potential for merging behavioral economic variables with proximal contextual effects to predict heavy drinking.},

  abstract = {Relative reinforcing efficacy refers to the behavior-strengthening or maintaining property of a reinforcer when compared to that of another reinforcer. Traditional measures of relative reinforcing efficacy sometimes have led to discordant results across and within studies. By contrast, previous investigations have found traditional measures to be congruent with behavioral economic measures, which provide a framework for integrating the discordant results. This study tested whether the previously demonstrated congruence between traditional relative reinforcing efficacy measures and behavioral economic demand curve measures is sufficiently robust to persist when demand for one reinforcer is altered. Cigarette smokers pulled plungers for cigarettes or two magnitudes of money on progressive-ratio schedules that increased the response requirement across sessions. Demand for the two different reinforcers was assessed in single-schedule and concurrent-schedule sessions. Demand curve measures Pmax and Omax correlated significantly with traditional measures of breakpoint and peak response rate, respectively. Relative locations of demand curves for money and cigarettes under single schedules predicted preference in concurrent schedules in most cases. Although measures of relative reinforcing efficacy for money changed with money magnitude, the congruence between traditional and behavioral economic measures remained intact. This robust congruence supports the proposal that demand curves should replace measures of relative reinforcing efficacy. The demand curve analysis illustrates why concordance between traditional measures is expected under some experimental conditions but not others.},

  abstract = {The Cigarette Purchase Task is a behavioral economic assessment tool designed to measure the relative reinforcing efficacy of cigarette smoking across different prices. An exponential demand equation has become a standard model for analyzing purchase task data, but its utility is compromised by its inability to accommodate values of zero consumption. We propose a two-part mixed effects model that keeps the same exponential demand equation for modeling nonzero consumption values, while providing a logistic regression for the binary outcome of zero versus nonzero consumption. Therefore, the proposed model can accommodate zero consumption values and retain the features of the exponential demand equation at the same time. As a byproduct, the logistic regression component of the proposed model provides a new demand index, the “derived breakpoint”, for the price above which a subject is more likely to be abstinent than to be smoking. We apply the proposed model to data collected at baseline from college students (N = 1,217) enrolled in a randomized clinical trial utilizing financial incentives to motivate tobacco cessation. Monte Carlo simulations showed that the proposed model provides better fits than an existing model. We note that the proposed methodology is applicable to other purchase task data, for example, drugs of abuse.},

However, a significant portion of this conflict is directed toward statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) that aggregate group and/or temporal variability into means and standard deviations and as a result remove much of the data important to behavior analysts. Mixed-effects modeling, a more recently developed statistical test, addresses many of the limitations of more basic tests by incorporating random effects. Random effects quantify individual subject variability without eliminating it from the model, hence producing a model that can predict both group and individual behavior. We present the results of a generalized linear mixed-effects model applied to single-subject data taken from Ackerlund Brandt, Dozier, Juanico, Laudont, \& Mick, 2015, in which children chose from one of three reinforcers for completing a task. Results of the mixed-effects modeling are consistent with visual analyses and importantly provide a statistical framework to predict individual behavior without requiring aggregation. We conclude by discussing the implications of these results and provide recommendations for further integration of mixed-effects models in the analyses of single-subject designs.},

  abstract = {Free and open-source software for applying models of operant demand called the Demand Curve Analyzer (DCA) was developed and systematically evaluated for use in research. The software was constructed to streamline the use of recommended screening measures, prepare suitable scaling parameters, fit one of several models of operant demand, and provide publication-quality figures. The DCA allows users to easily import price and consumption data into spreadsheet-based controls and to perform statistical modeling with the aid of a graphical user interface. The results from computer simulations and reanalyses of published study data indicated that the DCA provides results consistent with commercially available software that has been traditionally used to apply these analyses (i.e., GraphPadTM Prism). Further, the DCA provides additional functionality that other statistical packages do not include. Practical issues and future directions related to the determination of scaling parameter k, screening for nonsystematic data, and the incorporation of more advanced behavioral economic methods are also discussed.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT A relatively small percentage of humans who are exposed to drugs of abuse eventually become addicted to or dependent on those drugs. These individual differences in likelihood of developing drug addiction may reflect behavioral, neurobiological or genetic correlates of drug addiction and are therefore important to model. Behavioral economic measures of demand establish functions whose overall elasticity (rate of decrease in consumption as price increases) reflects the reinforcing effectiveness of various stimuli, including drugs. Using these demand functions, we determined the reinforcing effectiveness of five drugs of abuse (cocaine, remifentanil, ketamine, methohexital and ethanol) in 10 rhesus monkeys with histories of intravenous drug-taking. There was a continuum of reinforcing effectiveness across the five drugs, with cocaine and remifentanil showing the most reinforcing effectiveness. There was also a continuum of sensitivity of the monkeys; two of the 10 animals, in particular, showed greater demand for the drugs than did the remaining eight monkeys. In addition, monkeys that demonstrated greater demand for one drug tended to show greater demand for all drugs but did not show a similar relatively greater demand for sucrose pellets. These findings suggest that the tendency to find drugs to be reinforcing is a general one, not restricted to particular drugs and also, that a minority of animals show a substantially enhanced sensitivity to the reinforcing effects of drugs. The possibility that differences in responsiveness to the reinforcing effects of drugs may form the basis of individual differences in drug-taking in humans should be considered.},

Recent innovations in demand curve methods provide a credible means of quantitatively comparing qualitatively different reinforcers as well as quantifying the choice relations between concurrently available reinforcers. The potential of the behavioral economic approach to inform public policy is illustrated with examples from basic research, pre-clinical behavioral pharmacology, and clinical drug abuse research as well as emerging applications to public transportation and social behavior. Behavioral Economics can serve as a broadly applicable conceptual, methodological, and analytical framework for the development and evaluation of empirical public policy.},

Demand is another principle at the intersection of microeconomics and psychology that has helped advance research relevant to health behaviors. The purpose of the present study was to develop and test a demand measure related to sexual health decision-making and the influence of sexually transmitted infection (STI) risk. Participants (N = 438) recruited using Amazon Mechanical Turk completed a commodity purchase task assessing hypothetical condom demand. Condom demand was evaluated at varied prices for use with hypothetical sexual partners that varied in STI risk. Demand was characterized by prototypic decreases in consumption with increases in cost. Higher partner STI risk was associated with greater intentions for condom-protected sex at no cost and smaller decreases in condom demand with increases in cost. Price sensitivity was also related to individual difference factors relevant to sexual health (e.g., alcohol use severity, lower STI knowledge). This study supports the utility of a condom purchase task for indexing condom valuation and capturing individual difference and contextual risk factors relevant to STI transmission. Future studies may leverage this methodology as a means to study sexual health decision-making.},

  abstract = {Abstract Rats raised in an enriched condition (EC) show decreased stimulant self-administration relative to rats reared in an isolated condition (IC). However, few studies have examined the behavioral mechanisms underlying this environment-induced difference in self-administration. Because economic demand for drugs of abuse predicts addiction-like behavior in both humans and animals, we applied a behavioral economic analysis to cocaine self-administration data in EC and IC rats. During cocaine self-administration, the dose decreased across blocks of trials (0.75–0.003 mg/kg/inf), which allowed for a determination of demand intensity and demand elasticity. Demand intensity did not differ between EC and IC rats; however, cocaine was more elastic in EC rats relative to IC rats (i.e. EC rats were less willing to respond for cocaine as the unit price increased). When EC rats were placed in an isolated condition, demand elasticity decreased, whereas elasticity increased for IC rats placed in an enriched condition. Additionally, we applied behavioral economic analyses to previously published self-administration data and found that our results replicate past findings with cocaine and methylphenidate. To determine if differences in demand elasticity are specific to drug reinforcement, a separate group of rats was tested in sucrose or saccharin self-administration. Results showed that sucrose and saccharin were more elastic in EC rats relative to IC rats, and demand intensity was lower for saccharin in EC rats relative to IC rats. Overall, drug and nondrug reinforcers are more elastic in EC rats, which may account for the protective effects of environmental enrichment against stimulant self-administration.},

The constellation of behaviors associated with ultraviolet indoor tanning is analogous to that in other behavioral addictions. Despite a growing literature on ultraviolet indoor tanning as an addiction, there remains no consensus on how to identify ultraviolet indoor tanning addictive tendencies. The purpose of the present study was to translate a behavioral economic task more commonly used in substance abuse to quantify the 'abuse liability' of ultraviolet indoor tanning, establish construct validity, and determine convergent validity with the most commonly used diagnostic tools for ultraviolet indoor tanning addiction (i.e., mCAGE and mDSM-IV-TR). We conducted a between-groups study using a novel hypothetical Tanning Purchase Task to quantify intensity and elasticity of ultraviolet indoor tanning demand and permit statistical comparisons with the mCAGE and mDSM-IV-TR. Results suggest that behavioral economic demand is related to ultraviolet indoor tanning addiction status and adequately discriminates between potential addicted individuals from nonaddicted individuals. Moreover, we provide evidence that the Tanning Purchase Task renders behavioral economic indicators that are relevant to public health research. The present findings are limited to two ultraviolet indoor tanning addiction tools and a relatively small sample of high-risk ultraviolet indoor tanning users; however, these pilot data demonstrate the potential for behavioral economic assessment tools as diagnostic and research aids in ultraviolet indoor tanning addiction studies.},

Restricted maximum likelihood (REML) corrects this problem by using the likelihood of a set of residual contrasts and is generally considered superior.

We propose a REML-type estimator for generalised linear mixed models by correcting the bias in the profile score function of the variance components. The proposed estimator has the same consistency properties as the maximum likelihood estimator if the number of parameters in the mean and variance components models remains fixed. However, the estimator of the variance components has a smaller finite sample bias. A simulation study with a logistic mixed model shows that the proposed estimator is effective in correcting the downward bias in the maximum likelihood estimator.},

Single-case design consistently demonstrates that low treatment integrity slows or inhibits learning, but the relative impact of different types of instructional errors, or the presence of multiple errors, is less clear. The present study utilized a multilevel modeling approach to evaluate the impact of type of error (omission versus omission and commission) and error component (reinforcer delivery versus feedback) on learning. Findings revealed that learning outcomes worsened based on the type of error and as the complexity of errors increased; more specifically, participants performed better when only a single type of error occurred and when only a single error component was manipulated. Additionally, individual characteristics contributed to learning outcomes, highlighting the use of multilevel modeling as a helpful tool to supplement single-case design. The differential impact of integrity errors on learning may be due to timing of errors (i.e., commission errors more likely to occur early in learning) or how errors affect reinforcement schedule versus discriminative control.},

Rats were initially trained to self-administer 0.06 mg/kg/infusion nicotine (Phase 1), which was followed by a threshold procedure to determine nicotine demand via a behavioral economics (BE) paradigm (Phase 2). Rats then either self-administered the training dose (high dose group), or were switched to a low dose of nicotine (0.001 mg/kg/infusion; low dose group) in Phase 3. Both groups then underwent a second threshold procedure and demand curves were re-determined (Phase 4). In Phase 5, responding for nicotine was extinguished over the course of 21 sessions. Cue-induced reinstatement was then evaluated (Phase 6). Rats in the low dose group maintained a steady amount of infusions, and thus, did not compensate for nicotine reduction. Rats in the low dose group also showed similar demand elasticity and nicotine seeking (Phase 6) compared to the high dose group, indicating that nicotine reduction did not decrease nicotine demand or seeking. Further, both groups displayed resistance to extinction, indicating that nicotine reduction did not facilitate extinction learning. These results suggest that although compensation of intake does not occur, decreasing the dose of nicotine does not alter nicotine reinforcement value or relapse vulnerability. Further, these results indicate persistence of nicotine-motivated behavior after self-administration of a low nicotine dose. Translationally, these results suggest that alternative strategies may be needed to achieve positive smoking cessation outcomes.},

Research has shown that previous experiences during development, especially if stressful, can alter an organism’s response to opioids later in life. Given the previous literature on opioid modulation of cocaine self-administration, the current study raised rats in either an enriched condition (EC) or isolated condition (IC) and employed behavioral economics to study the effects of naltrexone and morphine on cocaine self-administration.
Methods
EC and IC rats were trained to lever press for cocaine using a within-session demand procedure. This procedure measured cocaine consumption under changing cocaine price by decreasing the dose of cocaine earned throughout a session. Rats were able to self-administer cocaine on a FR1; every 10min the cocaine dose was systematically decreased (0.75–0.003mg/kg/infusion cocaine). After reaching stability on this procedure, rats were randomly pretreated with 0, 0.3, 1, or 3mg/kg naltrexone once every 3days, followed by random pretreatments of 0, 0.3, 1, or 3mg/kg morphine once every 3days. Economic demand functions were fit to each rat’s cocaine consumption from each pretreatment, and appropriate mathematical parameters were extracted and analyzed.
Results
Naltrexone decreased the essential value of cocaine in IC rats only. However, morphine decreased the essential value of cocaine and the consumption of cocaine at zero price in both EC and IC rats.
Conclusion
These results indicate that environmental experiences during development should be considered when determining the efficacy of opioid drugs, especially for the treatment of substance abuse.},
